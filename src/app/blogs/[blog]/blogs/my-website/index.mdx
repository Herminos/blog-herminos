# Welcome to my 3rd generation website!
I still remember my first website was only HTML, no styling.
Just a simple website with a few pages.

My secomd website was HTML and CSS, no JavaScript and so ugly.
At that time my CSS was bad, I had no idea what is flex or grid.

Resonsive design was not a thing for me, the only thing moving on the page is some bad CSS animation.

Now, I am using Next.js, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS to build my website, This page is much more better in my opinion.

The blog system is based on MDX and dynamic routing, I can write my blog in Markdown and it will be half-automatically generated(I need to add the link on the blog page manually).
And it's much better than every blog is a HTML file.

I am still learning, I will keep updating this website.
